Changes:

MoveButton class created

Controller:
	added unselectItems()
		-unselects all currently selected items
	added public void moveItems(Point endPoint)
		-moves selected items to a given point, relative to the starting click position.
		
View:
	added private JButton moveButton
		added it properly to the panel lines 178 and 185
		
Item:
	added method :   public abstract void move(Point startPoint, Point endPoint);
		- Works by moving the points stored in the item the distance between the start and the end point.
		- Also added to each of the subclass items (oval, label, line)
		- I couldn't find any similar methods if this is the right spot to put the move method.
		- Polygon, when we get it implemented, will need this added
			(as a guess by iterating through each point and adding the offset), I already added it to oval.
		
Label:
	added method : public void setStartingPoint(Point point);
		-needed for my implementation of move() to change the label's point.
		
I probably forgot a few other changes that I did, sorry if it complicates things.
